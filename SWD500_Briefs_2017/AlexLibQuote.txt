In a work environment, there might be a number of people making changes to the pattern library, and so consideration for some sort of methodology/convention to help manage this will be needed. This (hopefully) means that the code won’t conflict with any future code.

Documentation makes up a large part of a good pattern library. Not everyone using them is going to be a seasoned front-end developer (designer, back-end developer). So it’s quite important that they’re as easy to understand as possible. Because ultimately, pattern libraries are about two things: Implementing consistency, and saving time.

Testing is also quite an important part. Pattern libraries are really good for testing individual components and identifying areas of weakness, well before they go anywhere near a production website/application. Maybe consider how the pattern libraries would make it easier to test individual patterns.
