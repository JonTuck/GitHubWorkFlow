### Assessment Task  - Responsive Design – Research, Planning and Experimentation.

1. What is the best approach for creating a fully responsive website/web app?
1. How should I test and validate my work?
1. How should I gain feedback throughout the design and production process?


### Overview

> "Mobile phones have reached a critical mass around the world, serving as constant companions for consumers regardless of demographics or geography."  [(Nielsen 2013)](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/how-the-mobile-consumer-connects-around-the-globe.html)

More and more people are using mobile devices to access on-line data, recent statistics from [Ericsson (2014)](http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2014/ericsson-mobility-report-august-2014-interim.pdf) put the total global mobile subscriptions at 6.8 billion of which 2.4 billion were for mobile broadband which seen a 35% increase in 12 months.

> "Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries are the three technical ingredients for responsive web design [...] Rather than quarantining our content into disparate, device-specific experiences, we can use media queries to progressively enhance our work within different viewing contexts." [(Marcotte 2010)](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)

Responsive Web Design (RWD) and [responsive design patterns](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514) is now essential part of a web designer's work flow, with many such as zurb.com (n.d.) arguing a "Mobile first" approach from the onset.

### Project Scenario

Students are free to choose a the theme/content to create a fully responsive website which adheres to current best practice, design trends and technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. **Hand code rather than use frameworks and libraries.**


**Project Considerations:**

* Semantic HTML
* Standards and compliance -HTML and CSS validates correctly via W3C Validation Services
* Demonstrated understanding of responsive design best practices  and Grids layouts.
* Appropriate use of HTML and CSS comments.
* Navigation
* Demonstrate understanding of fundamental responsive patterns.
* Page/screen layouts to adapt to a variety of screen sizes.
* Browser and device compatibility
* Responsive images
* Responsive typography
* Consideration for page/screen performance


**Approach** - Students will need to communicate their ideas through the production of a report in which they will provide a **rationale** for their production methods.

**Rationale - Research** - **Discuss** The current approaches to creating responsive websites to gain an **understanding** of different design principles and methods.

Conclude your **research** with **analysis** of the potential options to use creativity combined with technical skill to develop innovatively designed responsive concepts that show awareness of relevant principles and methods.

**Test Plan** - Students must **create** a responsive design Test Plan to prove the success of the project. The completed Test Plan (backed documented evidence) will be included in the Project Production (AE2) submission.

**Responsive Design Experimentation** - Outline how you could apply these specialised skills to the **produce** a fully responsive website through documentary evidence of experimentation using [http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io/).

### Suggested report layout:

Students will present their report and documentation of Responsive design experiments **as a single web page with  linked page appendices** which will include embedded CodePen Pens and animated gifs/short movie clips, **1500 words (-/+10%)** .

1. Introduction
1. Research & Options Analysis
1. Methods – Inc. projected breakdown of **148hrs for both AE1 (30%) & AE2 (70%)** cover all the research analysis, reporting, production and testing.
1. Specification - outline of project design needs, features and functions.
1. Test Plan –  For both technical and user Testing which will be completed and submitted for AE2
1. Experimentation – Documented CodePens, animated gifts/movies
1. References
1. Bibliography
1. Appendices (Presented as linked pages)

### Late Submissions

Students are reminded that:

1. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;
2. If this assessment is submitted later than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;
3. If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work (second or third attempt) then it must be submitted by the deadline date; any Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-assessment-policy-annex-1-assessment-regulations.pdf?t=1411116004479](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-assessment-policy-annex-1-assessment-regulations.pdf?t=1411116004479)

#### Extenuating Circumstances

The University's Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study', they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer).  In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence.   If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested.  Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact a Student Achievement Officer for advice.

A summary of guidance notes for students is given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1465219496259](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1465219496259)


#### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students' own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University's Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct.  Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2l-student-academic-misconduct.pdf?t=1465219589387](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2l-student-academic-misconduct.pdf?t=1465219589387)


#### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:
