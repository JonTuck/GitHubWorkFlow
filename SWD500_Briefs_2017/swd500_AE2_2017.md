### Assessment Task  - Responsive Design Project Production

> "Recently, an emergent discipline called " __responsive architecture__" has begun asking how physical spaces can __ __ respond __ __ to the presence of people passing through them."_ [(Marcotte 2010)](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)

This assessment (AE2) is a continuation of the work undertaken in AE1 which contained research, methods, project specification and experimentation .

Students will **construct** a fully working and tested responsive website, supported by their initial research and experimentation, students should also take note of any tutor feedback received for AE1.


**Recap of Project Scenario** (from AE1 brief)

**Creation of a fully responsive/adaptive website which adheres to current design trends and standard practice. You will be "hand coding" rather than using third-party frameworks such as bootstrap**

Students are free to choose a topic for their site as long as the following considerations are addressed:

* Semantic HTML
* Standards and compliance -HTML and CSS validates correctly via W3C Validation Services
* Demonstrated understanding of responsive design best practices and Grids layouts.
* Appropriate use of HTML and CSS comments.
* Navigation
* Demonstrate understanding of fundamental responsive patterns.
* Page/screen layouts to adapt to a variety of screen sizes.
* Browser and device compatibility
* Responsive images
* Responsive typography
* Consideration for page/screen performance


**Submission details**

Completed website will need to be 'live' using GitHub pages (You will also required to submit a zipped version to MyCourse). It is important you test its responsiveness on a variety of outputs based upon the test plan completed for AE1.

**Students will submit the following:**

**Planning**
1. Initial Hand drawn or Low Fidelity ideas
2. Refinement as Medium Fidelity wireframes/site maps.
1. Production of User interface Style guide
1. Final element and time management

**Evidence Testing:**
1. Completed Test Plan
1. Photographs, movies, screen captures and user feedback as supporting evidence of the Test Plan

**Completed Product:**
1. GitHub URL
1. Screen captures of the completed 6 pages/screens
1. Zipped file of completed website.

**The assessment is a MyCourse online submission consisting of a single Zipped upload.(50MB MAX)**

Remember to name your file to upload like this: **YOURSURNAME_SWD500_AE1**

### Late Submissions

Students are reminded that:

1. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;
2. If this assessment is submitted later than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;
3. If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work (second or third attempt) then it must be submitted by the deadline date; any Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-assessment-policy-annex-1-assessment-regulations.pdf?t=1411116004479](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2o-assessment-policy-annex-1-assessment-regulations.pdf?t=1411116004479)

#### Extenuating Circumstances

The University's Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study', they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer).  In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence.   If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested.  Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact a Student Achievement Officer for advice.

A summary of guidance notes for students is given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1465219496259](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf?t=1465219496259)


#### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students' own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University's Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct.  Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2l-student-academic-misconduct.pdf?t=1465219589387](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2l-student-academic-misconduct.pdf?t=1465219589387)


#### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:
