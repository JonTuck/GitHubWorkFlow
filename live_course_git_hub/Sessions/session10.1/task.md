#Set Up 

1) Within your `class_work` file, create a new folder and call it `week10`.

2) Open a terminal window and navigate to your `week10` folder.

3) Run the command `npm-init` and go through project options. 

4) We now need to install jQuery, so that we can use it in our project. Run the following command in your `week10` project directory:
	
	`npm install --save jquery`

If you look in your `node_modules`  directory and everything ran correctly. You should see that there is now a folder called `jQuery`. 

5) You can now include jQuery into your webpage in the normal way. 

`<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>`


    
6) Create the file `js/main.js` and include it in your html page below your inclusion of jQuery.
