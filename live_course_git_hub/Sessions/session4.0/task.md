#Task - Create your own grid 

This week we're going to create our own grid. We'll focus on making it responsive next week.

**I suggest you use code pen to create your grid, you'll then be able to link to it for your assessment**

**1)** Decide on the number of columns you want your grid to have, **12** is a common choice

**2)** Work out the width of a single column, **100% /number of columns**. When you know the width of a single column, you can the work out the width of further columns, for example a 3 column width will be **single column width * 3**

**3)** Go through the process outlined in the notes to create your grid

**4)**  Export your grid from codeine, by clicking `Export->export.zip`

**5)** Layout the website you created last week using your newly created css grid framework.
